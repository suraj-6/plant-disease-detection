## 🌍 Overview

Plant diseases cause massive losses in global agriculture every year — reducing yields, increasing costs, and threatening food security. Traditional diagnosis methods are slow, subjective, and often inaccessible to small farmers.

This project introduces an **AI-powered plant disease detection system** that:
- ✅ Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify 38+ plant diseases from leaf images.
- ✅ Integrates **Google Gemini API** to generate real-time, actionable treatment advice.
- ✅ Provides a **user-friendly web interface** built with Streamlit for farmers, researchers, and gardeners.

Empowering users with instant diagnosis + smart remedies = faster intervention → healthier crops → better harvests.

## 🗃️ Dataset

The model was trained on a curated dataset containing:

- **Total Images**: ~87,000 RGB images
- **Classes**: 38 disease categories + healthy variants
- **Crops Covered**: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato
- **Split**:
  - `train`: 70,295 images
  - `validation`: 17,572 images
  - `test`: 33 images (for final evaluation)

Dataset source: Publicly available plant disease datasets (e.g., PlantVillage), augmented offline.
